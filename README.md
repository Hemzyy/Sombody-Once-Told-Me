Send the shrek movie script line by line to anyone

## How to use
* You must install Python. You can install it at [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* You must install the Pynput library. You can do so by running `pip install pynput` on windows _or_ `pip3 install pynput` on mac.

1. Download the `shrek.py` file from above.
1. Launch your terminal app of choice (I use the cmd terminal).
2. Navigate to the folder that you saved "shrek.py" to by typing `cd path\to\shrek\`.

	_If you downloaded it into your downloads folder, you can simply run_ `cd Downloads`
3. Run the script by typing `python shrek.py`.
4. You now have 4 seconds to click whatever text field you want to type the movie's script into.
5. Enjoy!
